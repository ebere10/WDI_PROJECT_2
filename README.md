# WDI_PROJECT_2

This is my second project from my web development immersive course at General Assembly.

For this project I used the Google maps Api and I seeded my own data.
I created a website called Stay Quirky where users can select a pin on a map and view unusual and offbeat hotels around the world.

The landing page

Modals for user Register and login.

When logged in you're directed to the map.

Info window appears when pins are clicked on and map zooms in to location. When the info window is closed, the map zooms back out.

**What went well**

- It is a simple website but it works pretty well, it's cohesive and the colours work well together.


**What was a challenge**

- I found the css to be a little challenging. Even thoughI was able to get the website to display the way I wanted, I don't think I did it in the most practical fashion.
- Figuring out how to zoom back out of the map when the user closed the info window took me a while to solve.


Going forward, if I were to redo/rework this project then I would flesh it out a little more. I would have more info on the hotels and also a link to their website.
